Course Title | Surface Water Hydrology
Course Code | WRIE 2094  
 ECTS|   5

 **Course Description**

 The central message of the course is on transffering  the concepts and practical applications of the following topics to the students.

 1. Flood Routing; Reservoir Routing; Channel Routing.
 2. Frequency analysis of rainfall, low flow, floods and droughts.
 3. Reservoirs: determination of reservoir   capacity; reservoir sedimentation
 4.  Basic concepts of stochastic hydrology: parameter estimation, biased and unbiased statistics, time series analysis, consistency and homogeneity, hypothesis testing, trend and periodicity, histogram and frequency distributions: applications to flood frequency analysis, probable maximum precipitation and probable maximum floods.

**Course objectives &Competences to be Acquired**

After successful studying of the course, students will be able to:

-  Develope hydrographs, frequency analysis of, rainfall and stream flow data, flood routing, reservoir capacity determination and sedimentation, and statistical analysis of
hydrological parameters and generation of random number

- know and apply the different methods of data analysis and design in water resources engineering projects.

- appreciate the practical significance of the course in civil and water resources enginnering projects (urban drainage, irrigation drainage, reservior capacity, water supply and hydo power)
