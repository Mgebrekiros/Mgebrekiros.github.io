## Course Description

The hydrologic cycle, Precipitation: types of precipitation; measurement of rainfall; analysis and interpretation of precipitation data. Evaporation and transpiration; factors controlling evaporation and transpiration process; measurement of evaporation; estimation of potential evapotranspiration. Infiltration: factors affecting infiltration, measurement of infiltration; infiltration indices. Runoff: factors affecting runoff. Stream flow measurement. Hydrometry: the need for data, water level determination (direct stage read of gauges and recording limnmeters). Water depth and bottom level: mechanical and electronic devices, practical depth and stage measurement, flow velocity measurement: surface velocity, velocity in a single point: propeller type current meter, pitot tube, electromagnetic current meter, mean velocity: salt screen and floats.

## Course Objectives & Competences to be Acquired

After successful studying of the course, students will be able to:

- Get an insightful knowledge on hydrological cycle and its components.
- Understand the climatic variables and their effect on the hydrologic cycle.
- Identify and understand the methods of data measurement, collection, and storage of hydro-meteorological variables.
- Know and apply different methods of hydro-meteorological data analysis and design in water resources engineering projects.
- Appreciate the practical significance of the course in civil and water resources engineering projects (urban drainage, irrigation drainage, reservoir capacity, water supply, and hydro power).
