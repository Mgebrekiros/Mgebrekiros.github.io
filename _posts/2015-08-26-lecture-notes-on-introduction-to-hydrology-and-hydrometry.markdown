  **Course Description**

   The hydrologic cycle, Precipitation: types of precipitation; measurement of rainfall; analysis and interpretation of precipitation data. Evaporation and transpiration; factors controlling evaporation and transpirationprocess; measurement of evaporation; estimation of potential evapotranspiration. Infiltration: factors affecting infiltration,measurement of infiltration; infiltration indices .runoff: factors affecting runoff. Stream f low measurement. hydrometry: the need for data, water level determination,(direct stage read of gauges and recording limnmeters).water depth and bottom level: mechanical and electronic devices,practical depth and stage measurement, flow velocity measurement:surface velocity, velocity in a single point: propeller type current meter,pitot tube, electromagnetic current meter, mean velocity: salt screen and floats.

   **Course objectives &Competences to be Acquired**

   After successful studying of the course, students will be able to:

- get an insightful knowledge on hydrological cycle and its components.

- understand the climatic variables and its effect on the hydrologic cycle.

- identify and understand the methods of data measurement,collection, storage of hydro-meteorological variables.

- know and apply the different methods of hydro-meteorological data analysis and design in water resources engineering projects.

- appreciate the practical significance of the course in civil and water resources enginnering projects (urban drainage, irrigation drainage, reservior capacity, water supply and hydo power)
